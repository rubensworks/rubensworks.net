Governments typically store large amounts of personal information on their citizens, such as a home address, marital status, and occupation, to offer public services. Because governments consist of various governmental agen- cies, multiple copies of this data often exist. This raises concerns regarding data consistency, privacy, and access control, especially under recent legal frame- works such as GDPR. To solve these problems, and to give citizens true control over their data, we explore an approach using the decentralised Solid ecosys- tem, which enables citizens to maintain their data in personal data pods. We have applied this approach to two high-impact use cases, where citizen infor- mation is stored in personal data pods, and both public and private organisations are selectively granted access. Our findings indicate that Solid allows reshaping the relationship between citizens, their personal data, and the applications they use in the public and private sector. We strongly believe that the insights from this Flemish Solid Pilot can speed up the process for public administrations and private organisations that want to put the users in control of their data.

In addition to their latest version, Linked Open Datasets on the Web can also contain useful information in or between previous versions. In order to exploit this information, we can maintain history in RDF archives. Existing approaches either require much storage space, or they do not meet sufficiently expressive querying demands. In this extended abstract, we discuss an RDF archive indexing technique that has a low storage overhead, and adds metadata for reducing lookup times. We introduce algorithms based on this technique for efficiently evaluating versioned queries. Using the BEAR RDF archiving benchmark, we evaluate our implementation, called OSTRICH. Results show that OSTRICH introduces a new trade-off regarding storage space, ingestion time, and querying efficiency. By processing and storing more metadata during ingestion time, it significantly lowers the average lookup time for versioning queries. Our storage technique reduces query evaluation time through a preprocessing step during ingestion, which only in some cases increases storage space when compared to other approaches. This allows data owners to store and query multiple versions of their dataset efficiently, lowering the barrier to historical dataset publication and analysis.

Maintaining an Open Dataset comes at an extra recurring cost when it is published in a dedicated Web interface. As there is not often a direct financial return from publishing a dataset publicly, these extra costs need to be minimized. Therefore we want to explore reusing existing infrastructure by enriching existing websites with Linked Data. In this demonstrator, we advised the data owner to annotate a digital heritage website with JSON-LD snippets, resulting in a dataset of more than three million triples that is now available and officially maintained. The website itself is paged, and thus hydra partial collection view controls were added in the snippets. We then extended the modular query engine Comunica to support following page controls and extracting data from HTML documents while querying. This way, a SPARQL or GraphQL query over multiple heterogeneous data sources can power automated data reuse. While the query performance on such an interface is visibly poor, it becomes easy to create composite data dumps. As a result of implementing these building blocks in Comunica, any paged collection and enriched HTML page now becomes queryable by the query engine. This enables heterogenous data interfaces to share functionality and become technically interoperable.

GraphQL offers a highly popular query languages for graphs, which is well known among Web developers. Each GraphQL data graph is scoped within an interface-specific schema, which makes it difficult to integrate data from multiple interfaces. The RDF graph model offers a solution to this integration problem. Different techniques can enable querying over RDF graphs using GraphQL queries. In this position statement, we provide a high-level overview of the existing techniques, and how they differ. We argue that each of these techniques have their merits, but standardization is essential to simplify the link between GraphQL and RDF.

When publishing Linked Open Datasets on the Web, most attention is typically directed to their latest version.
Nevertheless, useful information is present in or between previous versions.
In order to exploit this historical information in dataset analysis, we can maintain history in RDF archives.
Existing approaches either require much storage space, or they expose an insufficiently expressive or efficient interface with respect to querying demands.
In this article, we introduce an RDF archive indexing technique that is able to store datasets with a low storage overhead,
by compressing consecutive versions and adding metadata for reducing lookup times.
We introduce algorithms based on this technique for efficiently evaluating queries at a certain version, between any two versions, and for versions.
Using the BEAR RDF archiving benchmark, we evaluate our implementation, called OSTRICH.
Results show that OSTRICH introduces a new trade-off regarding storage space, ingestion time, and querying efficiency.
By processing and storing more metadata during ingestion time, it significantly lowers the average lookup time for versioning queries.
OSTRICH performs better for many smaller dataset versions than for few larger dataset versions.
Furthermore, it enables efficient offsets in query result streams, which facilitates random access in results.
Our storage technique reduces query evaluation time for versioned queries through a preprocessing step during ingestion,
which only in some cases increases storage space when compared to other approaches.
This allows data owners to store and query multiple versions of their dataset efficiently,
lowering the barrier to historical dataset publication and analysis.

When benchmarking RDF data management systems such as public transport route planners,
system evaluation needs to happen under various realistic circumstances,
which requires a wide range of datasets with different properties.
Real-world datasets are almost ideal, as they offer these realistic circumstances, but they are often hard to obtain and inflexible for testing.
For these reasons, synthetic dataset generators are typically preferred over real-world datasets due to their intrinsic flexibility.
Unfortunately, many synthetic dataset that are generated within benchmarks are insufficiently realistic,
raising questions about the generalizability of benchmark results to real-world scenarios.
In order to benchmark geospatial and temporal RDF data management systems such as route planners with sufficient external validity and depth,
we designed PoDiGG, a highly configurable generation algorithm for synthetic public transport datasets
with realistic geospatial and temporal characteristics comparable to those of their real-world variants.
The algorithm is inspired by real-world public transit network design and scheduling methodologies.
This article discusses the design and implementation of PoDiGG and validates the properties of its generated datasets.
Our findings show that the generator achieves a sufficient level of realism,
based on the existing coherence metric and new metrics we introduce specifically for the public transport domain.
Thereby, podigg provides a flexible foundation for benchmarking RDF data management systems with geospatial and temporal data.

Query evaluation over Linked Data sources has become a complex story,
given the multitude of algorithms and techniques for single- and multi-source querying,
as well as the heterogeneity of Web interfaces through which data is published online.
Today’s query processors are insufficiently adaptable to test multiple query engine aspects in combination,
such as evaluating the performance of a certain join algorithm over a federation of heterogeneous interfaces.
The Semantic Web research community is in need of a flexible query engine that allows plugging in new components such as different algorithms,
new or experimental SPARQL features, and support for new Web interfaces.
We designed and developed a Web-friendly and modular meta query engine called Comunica that meets these specifications.
In this article, we introduce this query engine and explain the architectural choices behind its design.
We show how its modular nature makes it an ideal research platform for investigating new kinds of Linked Data interfaces and querying algorithms.
Comunica facilitates the development, testing, and evaluation of new query processing capabilities, both in isolation and in combination with others.

The Linked Open Data cloud has the potential of significantly enhancing and transforming end-user applications.
For example, the use of URIs to identify things allows data joining between separate data sources.
Most popular (Web) application frameworks, such as React and Angular have limited support for querying the Web of Linked Data,
which leads to a high-entry barrier for Web application developers.
Instead, these developers increasingly use the highly popular GraphQL query language for retrieving data from GraphQL APIs,
because GraphQL is tightly integrated into these frameworks.
In order to lower the barrier for developers towards Linked Data consumption, the Linked Open Data cloud needs to be queryable with GraphQL as well.
In this article, we introduce a method for transforming GraphQL queries coupled with a JSON-LD context to SPARQL,
and a method for converting SPARQL results to the GraphQL query-compatible response.
We demonstrate this method by implementing it into the Comunica framework.
This approach brings us one step closer towards widespread Linked Data consumption for application development.

This heterogeneity among Linked Data sources creates an added layer of complexity when querying or combining results from those sources.
To ease this problem, we created a modular engine, Comunica, that has modules for evaluating SPARQL queries and supports heterogeneous interfaces.
Other modules for other query or source types can easily be added.
In this paper we showcase a Web client that uses Comunica to evaluate federated SPARQL queries through automatic source type identification and interaction.

The domain of RDF versioning concerns itself with the storage of different versions of Linked Datasets.
The ability of querying over these versions is an active area of research, and allows for basic insights to be discovered,
such as tracking the evolution of certain things in datasets. Querying can however only get you so far.
In order to derive logical consequences from existing knowledge, we need to be able to reason over this data, such as ontology-based inferencing.
In order to achieve this, we explore fundamental concepts on semantic querying of versioned datasets using ontological knowledge.
In this work, we present these concepts as a semantic extension of the existing RDF versioning concepts that focus on syntactical versioning.
We remain general and assume that versions do not necessarily follow a purely linear temporal relation.
This work lays a foundation for reasoning over RDF versions from a querying perspective,
using which RDF versioning storage, query and reasoning systems can be designed.

RDF Stream Processing (RSP) is a rapidly evolving area of research that focuses on extensions of the Semantic Web in order to model and process Web data streams.
While state-of-the-art approaches concentrate on server-side processing of RDF streams,
we investigate the Triple Pattern Fragments Query Streamer (TPF-QS) method for server-side publishing of RDF streams,
which moves the workload of continuous querying to clients.
We formalize TPF-QS in terms of the RSP-QL reference model in order to formally compare it with existing RSP query languages.
We experimentally validate that, compared to the state of the art,
the server load of TPF-QS scales better with increasing numbers of concurrent clients in case of simple queries,
at the cost of increased bandwidth consumption.
This shows that TPF-QS is an important first step towards a viable solution for Web-scale publication and continuous processing of RDF streams.

One task in this challenge focuses on the storage and querying of versioned datasets,

In this article, we briefly introduce our system for the versioning task of this challenge.

For smart decision making, user agents need live and historic access to open data from sensors installed in the public domain.
In contrast to a closed environment, for Open Data and federated query processing algorithms,
the data publisher cannot anticipate in advance on specific questions,
nor can it deal with a bad cost-efficiency of the server interface when data consumers increase. When publishing observations from sensors,
different fragmentation strategies can be thought of depending on how the historic data needs to be queried.
Furthermore, both publish/subscribe and polling strategies exist to publish live updates.
Each of these strategies come with their own trade-offs regarding cost-efficiency of the server-interface, user-perceived performance and cpu use.
A polling strategy where multiple observations are published in a paged collection was tested in a proof of concept for parking spaces availability.
In order to understand the different resource trade-offs presented by publish/subscribe and polling publication strategies,
we devised an experiment on two machines, for a scalability test.
The preliminary results were inconclusive and suggest more large scale tests are needed in order to see a trend.
While the large-scale tests will be performed in future work,
the proof of concept helped to identify the technical Open Data principles for the 13 biggest cities in Flanders.

While humans browse the Web by following links, these hypermedia links can also be used by machines for browsing.
While efforts such as Hydra semantically describe the hypermedia controls on Web interfaces to enable smarter interface-agnostic clients,
they are largely limited to the input parameters to interfaces, and clients therefore do not know what response to expect from these interfaces.
In order to convey such expectations, interfaces need to declaratively describe the response structure of their parameterized hypermedia controls.
We therefore explored techniques to represent this parameterized response structure in a generic but expressive way.
In this work, we discuss four different approaches for declaring a response structure, and we compare them based on a model that we introduce.
Based on this model, we conclude that a SHACL shape-based approach can be used for declaring such a parameterized response structure,
as it conforms to the REST architectural style that has helped shape the Web into its current form.

Within computer science engineering, research articles often rely on software experiments in order to evaluate contributions.
Reproducing such experiments involves setting up software, benchmarks, and test data.
Unfortunately, many articles ambiguously refer to software by name only, leaving out crucial details for reproducibility,
such as module and dependency version numbers or the configuration of individual components in different setups.
To address this, we created the Object-Oriented Components ontology for the semantic description of software components and their configuration.
This article discusses the ontology and its application, and demonstrates with a use case how to publish experiments and their software configurations on the Web.
In order to enable semantic interlinking between configurations and modules,
we published the metadata of all 500,000+ JavaScript libraries on npm as 200,000,000+ RDF triples.
Through our work, research articles can refer by URL to fine-grained descriptions of experimental setups.
This brings us faster to accurate reproductions of experiments, and facilitates the evaluation of new research contributions with different software configurations. 
In the future, software could be instantiated automatically based on these descriptions and configurations,
reasoning and querying can be applied to software configurations for meta-research purposes.

Linked Datasets typically evolve over time because triples can be
removed from or added to datasets, which results in different dataset versions.
While most attention is typically given to the latest dataset version, a lot of useful
information is still present in previous versions and its historical evolution. In order
to make this historical information queryable at Web scale, a low-cost interface is
required that provides access to different dataset versions. In this paper, we add a
versioning feature to the existing Triple Pattern Fragments interface for queries at,
between and for versions, with an accompanying vocabulary for describing the
results, metadata and hypermedia controls. This interface feature is an important
step into the direction of making versioned datasets queryable on the Web, with a

A large amount of public transport data is made available by many different providers,
which makes RDF a great method for integrating these datasets.
Furthermore, this type of data provides a great source of information that combines both geospatial and temporal data.
These aspects are currently undertested in RDF data management systems, because of the limited availability of realistic input datasets.
In order to bring public transport data to the world of benchmarking, we need to be able to create synthetic variants of this data.
In this paper, we introduce a dataset generator with the capability to create realistic public transport data.
This dataset generator, and the ability to configure it on different levels,
makes it easier to use public transport data for benchmarking with great flexibility.

The process of extracting, structuring, and organizing knowledge from one or multiple data sources
and preparing it for the Semantic Web requires a dedicated class of systems.
They enable processing large and originally heterogeneous data sources and capturing new knowledge.
Offering existing data as Linked Data increases its shareability, extensibility, and reusability.
However, using Linking Data as a means to represent knowledge can be easier said than done.
In this tutorial, we elaborate on the importance of semantically annotating data and how existing technologies facilitate their mapping to Linked Data.
We introduce [R2]RML languages to generate Linked Data derived from different heterogeneous data formats –e.g.,  DBs, XML, or JSON–
and from different interfaces –e.g.,  files or Web apis.
Those who are not Semantic Web experts can annotate their data with the RMLEditor,
whose user interface hides all underlying Semantic Web technologies to data owners.
Last, we show how to easily publish Linked Data on the Web as Triple Pattern Fragments.
As a result, participants, independently of their knowledge background, can model, annotate and publish data on their own.

Linked Datasets typically change over time, and knowledge of this historical information can be useful.
This makes the storage and querying of Dynamic Linked Open Data an important area of research.
With the current versioning solutions, publishing Dynamic Linked Open Data at Web-Scale is possible, but too expensive.
We investigate the possibility of using the low-cost Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) interface to publish versioned Linked Open Data.
In this paper, we discuss requirements for supporting versioning in the TPF framework, on the level of the interface, storage and client,
and investigate which trade-offs exist. These requirements lay the foundations for further research in the area of low-cost,
Web-Scale dynamic Linked Open Data publication and querying.

The world contains a large amount of sensors that produce new data at
a high frequency. It is currently very hard to find public services that expose these
measurements as dynamic Linked Data. We investigate how sensor data can be
published continuously on the Web at a low cost. This paper describes how the
publication of various sensor data sources can be done by continuously mapping
raw sensor data to RDF and inserting it into a live, low-cost server. This makes it
possible for clients to continuously evaluate dynamic queries using public sensor
data. For our demonstration, we will illustrate how this pipeline works for the
publication of temperature and humidity data originating from a microcontroller,
and how it can be queried.

As the amount of generated sensor data is increasing, semantic
interoperability becomes an important aspect in order to support
efficient data distribution and communication. Therefore, the integration
of (sensor) data is important, as this data is coming from different
data sources and might be in different formats. Furthermore, reusable
and extensible methods for this integration are required in order to be
able to scale with the growing number of applications that generate semantic
sensor data. Current research efforts allow to map sensor data
to Linked Data in order to provide semantic interoperability. However,
they lack support for multiple data sources, hampering the integration.
Furthermore, the used methods are not available for reuse or are not extensible,
which hampers the development of applications. In this paper,
we describe how the RDF Mapping Language (RML) and a Triple Pattern
Fragments (TPF) server are used to address these shortcomings. The
demonstration consists of a micro controller that generates sensor data.
The data is captured and mapped to rdf triples using module-specific
RML mappings, which are queried from a TPF server.

Linked Data interfaces exist in many flavours, as evidenced by subject
pages, sparql endpoints, triple pattern interfaces, and data dumps. These interfaces
are mostly used to retrieve parts of a complete dataset, such parts can for example be
defined by ranges in one or more dimensions. Filtering Linked Data by dimensions
such as time range, geospatial area, or genomic location, requires the lookup of data
within ordinal ranges. To make retrieval by such ranges generic and cost-efficient,
we propose a REST solution in-between looking up data within ordinal ranges
entirely on the server, or entirely on the client. To this end, we introduce a method
for extending any Linked Data interface with an n-dimensional interface-level index
such that n-dimensional ordinal data can be selected using n-dimensional ranges.
We formally define Range Gates and Range Fragments and theoretically evaluate
the cost-efficiency of hosting such an interface. By adding a multidimensional
index to a Linked Data interface for multidimensional ordinal data, we found that
we can get benefits from both worlds: the expressivity of the server raises, yet
remains more cost-efficient than an interface providing the full functionality on
the server-side. Furthermore, the client now shares in the effort to filter the data.
This makes query processing becomes more flexible to the end-user, because the
query plan can be altered by the engine. In future work we hope to apply Range
Gates and Range Fragments to real-world interfaces to give quicker access to data
within ordinal ranges

To make continuous querying over dynamic Linked Data more affordable, we extend the low-cost Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) interface with support for time-sensitive queries.

Our experiments indicate that this extension significantly lowers the server complexity, at the expense of an increase in the execution time per query.
We prove that by moving the complexity of continuously evaluating queries over dynamic Linked Data to the clients and thus increasing bandwidth usage, 
the cost at the server side is significantly reduced.
Our results show that this solution makes real-time querying more scalable for a large amount of concurrent clients when compared to the alternatives.

For allowing a large number of concurrent clients to do continuous querying,

In this poster, we give the overview of a client-side RDF stream processing engine on top of TPF.
Our experiments show that our solution significantly lowers the server load while increasing the load on the clients.
Preliminary results indicate that our solution moves the complexity of continuously evaluating real-time queries
from the server to the client, which makes real-time querying much more scalable for a large amount of concurrent

Our society is evolving towards massive data consumption from heterogeneous sources, which includes rapidly changing data
like public transit delay information.
Many applications that depend on dynamic data consumption require highly available server interfaces.
Existing interfaces involve substantial costs to publish rapidly changing data with high availability,
and are therefore only possible for
organisations that can afford such an expensive infrastructure.
In my doctoral research, I investigate how to publish and consume real-time and historical Linked Data on a large scale.
To reduce server-side costs for making dynamic data publication affordable,
I will examine different possibilities to divide query evaluation between servers and clients.
This paper discusses the methods I aim to follow together with preliminary results and the steps required to use this solution.
An initial prototype achieves significantly lower server processing cost per query, while maintaining reasonable
query execution times and client costs.
Given these promising results, I feel confident this research direction is a viable solution for offering low-cost
dynamic Linked Data interfaces as opposed to the existing high-cost solutions.

This dissertation investigates the possibilities of having continuously updating
queries over Linked Data with a focus on server availability. This work builds upon the ideas
of Linked Data Fragments to let the clients do most of the work when executing a query. The
server adds metadata to make the clients aware of the data volatility for making sure the
query results are always up-to-date. The implementation of the framework that is proposed,
is eventually tested and compared to other alternative approaches.
