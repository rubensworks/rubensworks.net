## Short Biography

{:.cv-biography}
Ruben Taelman is a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/">KNoWS</a>, Ghent University – imec, Belgium.
He leads a team of researchers that focuses on querying over Decentralized Knowledge Graphs on the Web,
and investigating the trade-offs that exist between server and client.
He has contributed to this domain through publications in journals such as
the [Semantic Web Journal](http://semantic-web-journal.net/)
and the [Journal of Web Semantics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-web-semantics).
He has presented his work at various conferences and workshops such as
the [Web Conference](https://www.iw3c2.org/),
the [International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC)](http://swsa.semanticweb.org/content/international-semantic-web-conference-iswc),
and the [Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC)](https://eswc-conferences.org/).
Additionally, he has served as a reviewer and program committee member for these journals and conferences.
Furthermore, he is actively applying his research by developing various open-source [software libraries](/projects/)
that can be used by developers and other researchers.
The most notable among them is the <a href="https://comunica.dev/">Comunica query engine</a>,
which was the first engine to establish federated SPARQL querying over heterogeneous sources.
Today, Comunica is widely used within the scientific community and industry.
To ensure its long-term maintenance beyond research, he founded the non-profit Comunica Association.
Besides research, he teaches the fundamentals of Web technologies and Web querying at <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent University</a>.
