To fuel creation, I enjoy reading various books (usually in audio-format).
Curiosity is my primary driver for selecting these books,
and topics go far beyond the focus of my work and research.
However, these books sometimes lead to serendipitous scientific insights.

Below, I list selected books which significantly impacted me somehow,
together with a brief summary containing personal thoughts I had after reading.

## Philosophy

<div class="books">
  {% include book.html
     title="Meditations"
     authors="Marcus Aurelius"
	 img="/img/reading_list/meditations.jpg"
     link="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/nl/Aurelius-Marcus/dp/0140449337/"
     description="
	   These personal notes of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius contain a lot of stoic wisdom, in which he looks at things from the most useful perspective with a focus on reason.
	   For instance, death is an integral part of life which should not be feared.
	   Instead, focus on living itself and stop wasting your time on complaining yourself or hanging around people that complain.
	   And whatever distress you encounter by living is merely something you decide to inflict upon yourself.

     description="
	   This is probably the book that impacted my thinking the most.
	   It discusses twelve ways to add structure and responsibility to your life.
	   Some of the rules that I consider most significant are
	   \"Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today\",
	   \"Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world\", and
	   \"Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)\".

     link="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/nl/Mark-Manson/dp/0062457713/"
     description="
	   I consider this book to contain a lot of information similar to the stoic teachings,
	   but in a more modern and occasionally amusing format.
	   In essense, Mark Manson says that you should focus on what is important and meaningful to you.
	   Problems will always come and go, so don't worry too much about them.

     description="
	   For anything you want to achieve, you have to work for it. Hard.
	   Steven Pressfield explains that in order to accomplish something,
	   you must treat your dreams as a primary goal in your life.
	   You must invest as much time into it as possible, and don't avoid the work if you do not feel like it (i.e., repel Resistance).
	   If you truly commit to something, there is no limit to what you can achieve.

	   even though the world is continuously evolving towards a better place.
	   These improvements are illustrated with a large number of statistics,
	   ranging from massive reductions in poverty to improvements to overall happiness.
	   By applying rational principles, our world can keep improving.

     link="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/nl/Greg-Lukianoff/dp/0735224897/"
     description="
	   In this book, the authors argue that many of the problems in modern society originate from <i>the three great untruths</i>:
	   \"What doesnâ€™t kill you makes you weaker\"; \"always trust your feelings\"; and \"life is a battle between good people and evil people\".
	   It discusses how safetyism (microagressions, call-out culture, ...) is causing emotional harm in young people.

	   and need to face challenges to become stronger.

     description="
	   The author of this book explains how groups of people can become smarter than individuals.
	   An example of this is the fact that averaging the guesses of groups of people over the number of marbles in a container
	   will converge towards the actual number for increasing group sizes.
	   The stock market is another example of this, where the collective knowledge of individuals can lead to new insights.

     link="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/nl/Abigail-Shrier/dp/1800754132/"
     description="
	   In essence, the author of this book argues that we have been over-therapizing kids.
	   While children with real trauma do exist,
	   she explains how sending children to therapy that do not really need it,
	   can have a negative impact.
	   Therapy always comes with a risk, so if kids don't really need it, it may be better to avoid it.
	   This book reminded me a bit of <i>The Coddling of the American Mind</i>,
	   as the impact of coddling kids too much is discussed.

     description="
	   The author of this book argues that while it may sometimes feel like people have very conflicting views,
	   people are actually much more similar to each other than they are different.
	   This is motivated by analyzing the commonalities of various societies,
	   and recognizing that a kind of <i>social blueprint</i> emerges to which all successful societies conform.
	   This social blueprint contains universal elements such as friendship, love, and monogamy.

     description="
	   Gad Saad fled to Canada from Lebanon to escape anti-Jew persecution during the Civil War in Lebanon when he was young.
	   Inspired by this oppression, he became a well-known public intellectual against the oppressive nature of political correctness.
	   In this book, he argues that people should be free to say what they think, and that (self-)censorship is a threat to free speech and democracy.
	   He coins the term \"idea pathogens\" (also known as mind viruses), which are irrational ideas that can easily spread within society.
	   He argues that people infected by these idea pathogens are not willing to engage in public debate,
	   in which such ideas could be easily disproven.

	   While the title is primarily an attention-grabber, the author of this book actually argues that there are no idiots.
	   Instead, four different categories of people are explained (red, yellow, green, and blue),

	   Red people are dominant, yellow people are social and cheerful. Greens are stable, and blues are analytic.
